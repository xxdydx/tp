### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. Note that `Tag` and `Category` is interchangeable. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Person Type Feature

#### Implementation

The Person Type feature allows KnotBook to distinguish between clients and vendors. This is implemented through the `PersonType` enum class.

**Key Components:**
* `PersonType` enum - Defines two types: `CLIENT` and `VENDOR`
* `Person` class - Contains a `PersonType` field to categorize each contact
* `AddCommandParser` - Parses the `type/` prefix to determine the person type

**Design Considerations:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use an enum for PersonType
  * Pros: Type-safe, prevents invalid values, easy to extend
  * Cons: Requires code changes to add new types
  
* **Alternative 2:** Use a String field for type
  * Pros: More flexible, can add types dynamically
  * Cons: No compile-time type checking, prone to typos and inconsistencies

The enum approach was chosen for better type safety and to ensure data consistency across the application.

### Wedding Date Feature

#### Implementation

The Wedding Date feature stores the date of a client's wedding event. This is implemented through the `WeddingDate` class in the `seedu.address.model.date` package.

**Key Components:**
* `WeddingDate` class - Validates and stores wedding dates
* `Person` class - Contains a `WeddingDate` field
* `AddCommandParser` - Parses the `date:` prefix to extract wedding dates

**Design Considerations:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Create a dedicated `WeddingDate` class
  * Pros: Encapsulates validation logic, can add date-specific methods
  * Cons: Additional class to maintain
  
* **Alternative 2:** Use Java's `LocalDate` directly
  * Pros: Simpler, uses standard library
  * Cons: Less control over validation and formatting

The dedicated class approach provides better encapsulation and allows for custom validation rules specific to wedding planning.

### Category Filter (Cat Command) Feature

#### Implementation

The Cat Command allows users to filter contacts by their category/type. This is implemented through the `CatCommand` class.

**Key Components:**
* `CatCommand` - Executes the category filtering
* `CatCommandParser` - Parses the category parameter
* `Model` - Updates the filtered person list based on category

**Usage:**
```
cat florist
```

This command filters and displays all contacts categorized as "florist".

**Design Considerations:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Case-insensitive matching
  * Pros: More user-friendly, reduces errors
  * Cons: Slightly more complex comparison logic
  
* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive matching
  * Pros: Simpler implementation
  * Cons: Less forgiving for users

Case-insensitive matching was chosen to improve user experience and reduce input errors.

### Link/Unlink Feature

#### Implementation

The Link and Unlink features allow wedding planners to create and remove associations between clients and vendors.

**Key Components:**
* `LinkCommand` - Creates a link between a client and vendor
* `UnlinkCommand` - Removes a link between a client and vendor
* `LinkCommandParser` / `UnlinkCommandParser` - Parse client and vendor indices

**Usage:**
```
link client/1, vendor/3
unlink client/1, vendor/3
```

**Sequence Diagram for Link Command:**

The following sequence diagram shows how the link operation works:

1. User enters `link client/1, vendor/3`
2. `AddressBookParser` creates a `LinkCommandParser`
3. `LinkCommandParser` parses the indices and creates a `LinkCommand`
4. `LinkCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`
5. `LinkCommand` retrieves the client and vendor from the filtered list
6. `LinkCommand` validates the indices
7. Link is created (future implementation will update Person objects)
8. Success message is returned

**Design Considerations:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use indices from the displayed list
  * Pros: Intuitive, works with filtered lists
  * Cons: Indices change when list is filtered
  
* **Alternative 2:** Use unique IDs or names
  * Pros: More stable references
  * Cons: Requires users to remember/type full names or IDs

Index-based linking was chosen for consistency with other commands (delete, edit) and ease of use.

### Enhanced Help Window Feature

#### Implementation

The Help Window has been enhanced to display all command formats in an accordion-style interface with collapsible dropdowns.

**Key Components:**
* `HelpWindow` - JavaFX controller for the help window
* `HelpWindow.fxml` - FXML layout with ScrollPane and VBox
* `Accordion` and `TitledPane` - JavaFX components for collapsible sections

**Key Changes:**
1. Removed hardcoded help URL and copy button
2. Added dynamic help message builder that pulls from each command's `MESSAGE_USAGE` constant
3. Implemented accordion UI with one `TitledPane` per command
4. Made window resizable with scrollable content

**Design Considerations:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Accordion with collapsible panes
  * Pros: Clean interface, only shows relevant information, easy to navigate
  * Cons: Requires more clicks to view all commands
  
* **Alternative 2:** Single scrollable text area with all commands
  * Pros: All information visible at once
  * Cons: Cluttered, overwhelming for new users

The accordion approach was chosen to reduce visual clutter and improve user experience, especially for new users who may be overwhelmed by seeing all commands at once.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

**Persona: Sarah, 29-year-old Freelance Wedding Planner in Singapore**

* Wedding planners who need to manage multiple clients and vendors simultaneously
* Freelance professionals who work independently but collaborate closely with vendors
* Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (clients, florists, caterers, photographers, musicians, venues)
* Prefer desktop apps over other types for centralized information management
* Can type fast and prefer typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* Currently struggles with scattered information across WhatsApp, Excel, and paper notes
* Needs to track vendor information, quotes, and categorize them by type
* Manages multiple weddings at different stages of planning
* Experiences peak seasons with high stress and time pressure
* Requires quick retrieval of vendor details and client preferences
* Needs to track budgets with clarity and accuracy to avoid overspending

**Value proposition**: KnotBook solves the problem of scattered and inconsistent information management for wedding planners. It provides a centralized, fast, and reliable contact management system that eliminates the need to search across multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Excel, paper notes). Wedding planners can store and retrieve vendor and client information instantly, track event budgets with accuracy, and easily search, sort, and update information when plans changeâ€”all faster than typical mouse/GUI driven apps. This reduces lost time, minimizes stress during peak seasons, and prevents costly mistakes like double-booking vendors or overspending on budgets.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  **Portability**: Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  **Performance**: Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  **Usability**: A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  **Reliability**: The system should not lose data in case of unexpected application crashes.
5.  **Data Integrity**: The system should prevent duplicate entries (contacts with the same phone number OR email) from being added.
6.  **Privacy**: Client and vendor information should be stored locally on the user's machine and not transmitted over any network.
7.  **Usability**: Error messages should be clear and informative, guiding users on how to correct their input.
8.  **Compatibility**: Should work without requiring an internet connection (offline-first design).
